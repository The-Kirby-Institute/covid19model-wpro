# Serial Interval Estimates

# Note from James
# "Note that it's the generation interval that you technically want (and
# what they [Science paper or Imperial College] estimate here) . the
# generation interval is
# the time between exposure in infector and infectee. What you can measure
# usually is the serial interval (time between symptoms in infector and
# infectee) . if you also have the distribution of time to symptoms, then
# you can deconvolve the serial interval into a generation interval. Anyway,
# the main reason to do this is that estimated serial intervals have the
# same mean but an exaggerated variance . this tends to lead to
# underestimates of R0."

# Distributions from Science paper

# The distribution is lognormal with mean 5.5 days, median 5.2 days and
# standard deviation 2.1 days

mean <- 5.5
median <- 5.2
sd <- 2.1

   iqrl = quantile(vector, probs = 0.25),

# Final Serial.Interval selected
# Originally went with the gamma fit but more recent serial interval data
# suggests a lower mean. Serial interval Distribution from WHO update 
# 15 April: 4.8 (IQR: 3.7 â€“ 5.2) from 8 studies. Upper IQR seems a bit tight
# though. In version 1 of the Imperial model this produced
# a reaseonable R0 but version 2 and above seemed to result in an R0 > 3.
# Weibull distribution seems to be a better fit now. 

# Going with the Weibull(replace serial_interval.csv with the new file)
